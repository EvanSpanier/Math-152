In other words, $L(R)$ is the number of points $(a,b)$ with integers $a,b$ satisfying $a^2 + b^2 \\leq R^2$.  (Note I've used a less-than-or-equal here).\n",

In a letter to Mersenne written on Christmas day, Fermat mentioned that $p$ can be expressed as a sum of two squares if and only if $p \\div 4$ leaves a remainder of $1$, i.e., if $p = 4n+1$ for some integer $n$.  For example, $73$ is such a prime number ($73 = 4(18) + 1$) and $73 = 8^2 + 3^2$.  On the other hand, $7$ is not such a prime number.  Note that $7 = 4(1) + 3$, and $7$ cannot be written as $x^2 + y^2$ for integers $x$ and $y$.\n",

For example, a prime $p$ can be expressed as $x^2 + 3y^2$ if and only $p \\div 12$ equals 1 or 7 (or if $p=3$).  For example $7 = 2^2 + 3(1^2)$ and $13 = 1^2 + 3(2^2)$.  \n",

A reciprocity law here is a theorem of the form:  A prime number $p$ can be expressed as $x^2 + N y^2$ if and only if $p \\div M$ belongs to a certain finite set.  E.g., one can take $N = 3$ and $M = 12$, and the finite set would be $1,3,7$.  Typically one looks at $M = 4N$, in fact.\n",

One list will be the list of x-coordinates of vertices, and the other will be the list of y-coordinates of vertices.  For example, if `xlist = [1,2,3]` and `ylist = [4,5,6]`, then these describe the triangle with vertices at $(1,4)$ and $(2,5)$ and $(3,6)$.\n",

Write a function which takes in an xlist and ylist, and determines whether the resulting polygon is simple.  Note that the xlist and ylist are mean to give the x and y coordinates of the vertices, going around the polygon in order.

You can use the Euclidean algorithm to count edge lattice points, and previous parts to figure out areas.  Use these together to write a function which finds the number of *interior* lattice points inside any simple polygon.\n",
