A nice fact about Python, for mathematicians, is that it handles exact integers of arbitrary length!

In Python 2.x, there were two types: *int* for somewhat small integers (e.g., up to $2^{31}$) and *long* type for all larger integers.  Python 2.x would signal which type of integer was being used, by placing the letter \"L\" at the end of a long integer.  Now, in Python 3.x, the programmer doesn't really see the difference.  There is only the *int* type.  But Python still optimizes computations, using hardware functionality for arithmetic of small integers and custom routines for large integers.  The programmer doesn't have to worry about it most of the time.\n",
